## Tmux
- Ctrl-B has been remapped to the backtick character (`). If you want to type the actual backtick character (`) itself, just hit the key twice.
- `%` has been remapped to `v`.
- Use `ctrl`+`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`vim movement keys for moving between panes.
- Status bar tells you date, time, user, and hostname. Especially useful with nested ssh sessions.
